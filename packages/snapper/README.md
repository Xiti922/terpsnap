# Provider Library for Cosmos Extension for Metamask
Snapper is a utility library for interacting with the official Cosmos Extension for Metamask.

## Global Provider (Drop In Replacement for window.keplr)
Add the provider as a global object within your dApp.
```typescript
import { CosmosSnap } from "@cosmsnap/snapper";
window.cosmos = new CosmosSnap();

const memo = "Hello from Metamask!";

let offlineSigner = await window.cosmos.getOfflineSigner("morocco-1");

let wallet = await window.cosmos.getAccount("morocco-1");

// Create a send token message
const msg = {
    typeUrl: "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
    value: {
    fromAddress: wallet.address,
    toAddress: "cosmos123456789",
    amount: [
        {
        denom: "uatom",
        amount: "10000",
        },
    ],
    },
};

// Create fee
const fee = {
    amount: [],
    gas: "200000",
};

const signingClient = await SigningStargateClient.connectWithSigner(
    "https://rpc-cosmoshub.whispernode.com:443",
    offlineSigner
);

const result = await signingClient.sign(wallet.address, [msg], fee, memo);
```

Use in development mode.
`Note:` You must run the snap locally for this to run properly.
```typescript
window.cosmos.changeSnapId("local:http://localhost:8080");
```

Structure of the provider.
```typescript
export interface SnapProvider {
  experimentalSuggestChain(chainInfo: ChainInfo): Promise<void>;
  signAmino(
    chainId: string,
    signer: string,
    signDoc: StdSignDoc,
  ): Promise<AminoSignResponse>;
  signDirect(
    chainId: string,
    signer: string,
    signDoc: {
      /** SignDoc bodyBytes */
      bodyBytes?: Uint8Array | null;

      /** SignDoc authInfoBytes */
      authInfoBytes?: Uint8Array | null;

      /** SignDoc chainId */
      chainId?: string | null;

      /** SignDoc accountNumber */
      accountNumber?: Long | null;
    },
  ): Promise<DirectSignResponse>;
  sendTx(
    chainId: string,
    tx: Uint8Array,
  ): Promise<DeliverTxResponse>;
  getOfflineSigner(chainId: string): Promise<OfflineAminoSigner & OfflineDirectSigner>;
  enabled(): Promise<boolean>;
  install(): Promise<void>;
  getChains(): Promise<Chain[]>;
  deleteChain(chain_id: string): Promise<void>;
  signAndBroadcast(chain_id: string, msgs: Msg[], fees: Fees): Promise<DeliverTxResponse>;
  sign(chain_id: string, msgs: Msg[], fees: Fees): Promise<Int8Array>;
  addAddressToBook(chain_id: string, address: string, name: string): Promise<void>;
  getAddressBook(): Promise<Address[]>;
  deleteAddressFromBook(address: string): Promise<void>;
  getBech32Addresses(): Promise<CosmosAddress[]>;
  getBech32Address(chain_id: string): Promise<CosmosAddress>;
  getAccount(chain_id: string): Promise<AccountData>;
  changeSnapId(snap_id: string): void;
}
```
## Direct Interaction Functions
You can interact with the snap directly to with these functions although we highly suggest using the provider through the window as it is a drop in replacement for other Cosmos wallets.

### Check If Installed
```typescript
import { isSnapInstalled } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
let result: boolean = await isSnapInstalled();
```

### Check If Initialized
```typescript
import { isSnapInitialized } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
let result: boolean = await isSnapInitialized();
```

### Install The Cosmos Extension.
```typescript
import { installSnap } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
await installSnap();
```

### Suggest Chain.
Use the format like [here](https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry/blob/master/agoric/chain.json) in the chain registry. The more info the better.
```typescript
import { suggestChain } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
let chain: Chain = {};
await suggestChain(chain);
```

### Get Chains.
Gets all the chains that are in state within the snap.
```typescript
import { getChains } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
let chains: []Chain = await getChains();
```

### Delete Chain.
Delete a chain from wallet state.
```typescript
import { deleteChain } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
await deleteChain("morocco-1");
```

### Sign & Broadcast.
Sign and broadcast a transaction. Note, you can use our production grade infrastructure (RPCs) to broadcast transactions using this function.
```typescript
import { signAndBroadcast } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
import { DeliverTxResponse } from "@cosmjs/stargate";

const msgs = [
    {
        typeUrl: "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
        value: {
            fromAddress: senderAddress,
            toAddress: recipientAddress,
            amount: [{
                denom: "uatom",
                amount: "500000"
            }],
        },
    }
];
const fees = {
    amount: [{
        denom: "uatom",
        amount: "500"
    }],
    gas: "200000"
};
let txResult: DeliverTxResponse = await signAndBroadcast("morocco-1", msgs, fees);
```

### Sign Transaction.
Just sign a transaction and return it. Note, this does not use our production grade infrastructure. You must use your own to broadcast the transaction.
```typescript
import { sign } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
import { DeliverTxResponse } from "@cosmjs/stargate";

const msgs = [
    {
        typeUrl: "/cosmos.bank.v1beta1.MsgSend",
        value: {
            fromAddress: senderAddress,
            toAddress: recipientAddress,
            amount: [{
                denom: "uatom",
                amount: "500000"
            }],
        },
    }
];
const fees = {
    amount: [{
        denom: "uatom",
        amount: "500"
    }],
    gas: "200000"
};
let txResult: DeliverTxResponse = await sign("morocco-1", msgs, fees);
```

### Add Address to Address Book.
```typescript
import { addAddressToBook } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
await addAddressToBook("morocco-1", "cosmos123456789", "John Doe");
```

### Get Address Book
```typescript
import { getAddressBook } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
let book: Address[] = await getAddressBook();
```

### Delete Address from Address Book
```typescript
import { deleteAddressFromBook } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
await deleteAddressFromBook("cosmos123456789");
```

### Get All Bech32 Addresses
Gets all the Bech32 addresses for all chains in state. Note, this is an expensively heavy operation so use wisely.
```typescript
import { getBech32Addresses } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
let allAddresses: CosmosAddress[] = await getBech32Addresses();
```

### Get All Bech32 Addresses
Gets a Bech32 address for a chain.
```typescript
import { getBech32Addresses } from '@cosmsnap/snapper';
let address: CosmosAddress = await getBech32Address("morocco-1");
```
